# stablecodetutor
The Interactive Coding Tutor facilitates beginners real-time feedback, suggestions, and explanations.
Certainly! Building an interactive coding tutor that leverages the StableCode model can be an exciting and educational project. Here's a detailed breakdown of how you could approach this idea:

**Project: Interactive Coding Tutor with StableCode**

**Overview:**
The Interactive Coding Tutor is a web application that assists novice programmers in learning programming concepts and improving their coding skills. It provides real-time feedback, suggestions, and explanations as users attempt coding exercises and challenges.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication and Profiles:**
   Allow users to create accounts and log in. Each user should have a personalized profile where their progress, completed exercises, and achievements are tracked.

2. **Exercise Library:**
   Create a library of programming exercises covering various difficulty levels and programming concepts. Each exercise should come with a description, a code editor, and an expected output or behavior.

3. **Real-time Code Analysis:**
   Integrate a code editor with real-time syntax highlighting and analysis. As users type code, the system should use the StableCode model to analyze the code for errors, suggest improvements, and provide explanations for various coding decisions.

4. **Feedback and Suggestions:**
   Based on the analysis, provide immediate feedback and suggestions to users. If the user makes a syntax error, the system should highlight the error and provide guidance on how to correct it. If the user's code could be optimized, the system should suggest more efficient alternatives.

5. **Explanation Generation:**
   Use the StableCode model to generate explanations for coding concepts. When a user encounters a new concept, the tutor can provide an explanation that breaks down the concept and provides examples. This could include explanations of data types, control structures, functions, and more.

6. **Progress Tracking and Gamification:**
   Track users' progress as they complete exercises. Award points or badges for completing exercises, writing efficient code, or mastering specific concepts. Gamification can motivate users to continue learning and improving.

7. **Community Interaction:**
   Allow users to share their code and solutions with the community. They can ask questions, receive feedback from peers, and collaborate on solving challenges.

8. **Learning Paths:**
   Offer predefined learning paths that guide users through a series of exercises, gradually increasing in complexity. Learning paths can be tailored to different programming languages and concepts.

9. **Responsive Design:**
   Ensure that the web application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless learning experience.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Design the user interface for the web application, including the exercise library, code editor, and user profiles.
2. Integrate a code editor component that supports real-time syntax highlighting and analysis.
3. Set up user authentication and database to store user profiles, exercise data, and progress.
4. Integrate the StableCode API to analyze code and generate explanations for coding concepts.
5. Develop the feedback and suggestions system based on the analysis from StableCode.
6. Implement the progress tracking and gamification features.
7. Create a mechanism for users to interact with the community and share their solutions.
8. Test the application thoroughly, focusing on usability, responsiveness, and accuracy of feedback.
9. Deploy the application to a web server and make it accessible to users.
10. I have deployed it on streamlit.

tokens = model.generate(
  **inputs,
  max_new_tokens=48,
  temperature=0.2,
  do_sample=True,
)
print(tokenizer.decode(tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True))```
